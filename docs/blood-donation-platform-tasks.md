# Tasks: Blood Donation Platform

## Phase 1: Setup & Architecture
- [ ] T001 Initialize Git repo, setup feature branch workflow
- [ ] T002 Configure CI/CD pipeline (testing, deployment)
- [ ] T003 Setup environments (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] T004 Install frontend dependencies (React.js, TypeScript, Redux/Zustand, Tailwind, PWA)
- [ ] T005 Install backend dependencies (Node.js, Express.js, Supabase, Socket.io)

## Phase 2: User Management & Authentication

- [ ] T007 Integrate multi-factor verification (email, phone, Google OAuth)
- [ ] T008 Build medical screening questionnaire
- [ ] T009 Rotaract club member registration & verification

## Phase 3: Matching & Communication
- [ ] T010 Design Supabase PostgreSQL schema for users, requests, clubs, events
- [ ] T011 Implement matching algorithm (blood type, proximity, availability, hospital priority)
- [ ] T012 Integrate Google Maps API for location services
- [ ] T013 Build real-time messaging (Socket.io)
- [ ] T014 Implement OTP verification system
- [ ] T015 Integrate push notifications (FCM)

## Phase 4: Tracking & Analytics
- [ ] T016 Build donation history dashboard
- [ ] T017 Implement eligibility tracking and reminders
- [ ] T018 Create statistics dashboard
- [ ] T019 Automate post-donation follow-up

## Phase 5: Rotaract Club Management
- [ ] T020 Build club directory and dashboard
- [ ] T021 Implement event management for blood drives
- [ ] T022 Service hour logging and reporting

## Phase 6: Integration & External Services
- [ ] T023 Integrate Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (email), Google OAuth
- [ ] T024 Connect Rotaract club database, calendar integration

## Phase 7: Quality Assurance
- [ ] T025 Write unit, integration, E2E, security, performance tests
- [ ] T026 Setup monitoring, analytics, compliance checks

## Phase 8: Deployment & Infrastructure
- [ ] T027 Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify), backend (Railway/Heroku)
- [ ] T028 Configure Supabase managed PostgreSQL
- [ ] T029 Setup CDN, SSL/TLS, daily backups, multi-region
- [ ] T030 Final documentation and handoff

## Parallel Execution Guidance
- Setup (T001-T005) before all other phases
- Tests before implementation in each phase
- Backend and frontend tasks can run in parallel after initial setup
- Integration and QA tasks grouped for efficiency
