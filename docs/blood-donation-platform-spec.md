# Specification: Blood Donation Platform

## Project Overview
A web application connecting blood donors and recipients with real-time matching, secure communication, and Rotaract club integration for RID 3233 & 3234.

## Core Product Requirements

### 1. User Management & Authentication
- Dual-profile system: separate flows for donors and recipients
- Multi-factor verification: email/phone, document upload, Google OAuth
- Data collection: blood type, medical history, location, emergency contacts
- Medical screening: eligibility questionnaire
- Rotaract integration: club member registration and verification

### 2. Intelligent Matching System
- Smart matching: blood type, proximity, donor status/history
- Map interface: area-level privacy
- Hospital priority: partner hospitals prioritized
- Advanced filtering: distance, availability, blood type, verification

### 3. Real-Time Communication
- Secure in-app messaging: end-to-end encrypted
- OTP verification: 6-digit, time-limited, donation confirmation
- Push notifications: urgent alerts
- Quick response templates
- Emergency override for medical professionals

### 4. Tracking & Analytics
- Donation history dashboard
- Eligibility tracking and reminders
- Statistics dashboard: impact metrics
- Post-donation follow-up

### 5. Rotaract Club Management
- Club directory and dashboard
- Event management: blood drives
- Service hour logging

## Technical Requirements

- Google Maps API
- Socket.io client

### Backend
- Node.js + Express.js
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- Socket.io server

- Notification system: priority levels, escalation, user preferences, quiet hours
- Data privacy: anonymized location, encrypted comms, consent management

## Integration
- Google Maps, Twilio, SendGrid, Google OAuth, FCM
- Rotaract club database, member verification, service hour logging

## Performance & Scalability
- <2s page load, <200ms messaging, <3s map render, <1s search
- 1000+ concurrent users, 500+ WebSocket connections

## Quality Assurance
- 80%+ unit test coverage
- Integration/E2E/security/performance testing
- Monitoring: APM, analytics, compliance, health

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- Git, CI/CD, multi-env
- Vercel/Netlify frontend, Railway/Heroku backend
- Supabase managed PostgreSQL
- CDN, SSL/TLS, daily backups

## Success Metrics
- Donation success rate, engagement, response time, coverage
- Registration conversion, retention, club participation, reliability

## Compliance & Accessibility
- HIPAA-equivalent, retention, consent, cross-border
